# Case Study 1:
- Google Drive allows you to create nested folders. We need to replicate this functionality. End application will
  - Allow user to open a folder and show its content (for now a folder may contain one or more sub folders)
  - Allow user to create a new folder considering current opened folder as parent folder. Folder at first level will have parent as null in database.
- Note: We are not going to create any physical folders but creating a folder means adding a new record in table.

## Task 1
- Try to implement above case study using JavaScript, HTML & CSS. You may involve server side + database if you want but through APIs. Otherwise you may use browser localStorage to save data.

## Task 2
- Try to implement above case study using ReactJS, HTML & CSS. You may involve server side + database if you want but through APIs. Otherwise you may use browser localStorage to save data.

## Task 3
- Try to implement above case study using Angular, HTML & CSS. You may involve server side + database if you want but through APIs. Otherwise you may use browser localStorage to save data.
